        <p>The Vulgar Unicorn BBS started in 1981 as an Atari BASIC BBS running on a 300 baud modem.
        December 19, 2022, I decided to attempt to rebuild what I always wanted in a BBS, and nearly got there in the mid-late 80's.
        TVU is not just the BBS iteself, but also the software running the board.  Written in Go, and supporting all the cool stuff I ever wanted.</p>
